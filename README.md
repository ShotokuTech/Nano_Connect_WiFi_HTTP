Can Two Arduino Nano RP2040 Connects Communicate?
This video picks up were we left off in Nano RP2040 Connect Web Server Mashup. I have two of these Nano Connect boards. Now lets see how we can get one Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect to interact with the other over the web using wifi and http. We're  mashing up the LSM6DSOX SimpleAccelerometer sketch with the WiFiNINA WiFi Web Client Repeating sketch.
